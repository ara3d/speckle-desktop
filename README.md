# About the Project 

This is my entry into the June 2024 Speckle Hackathon [*Beyond the Speckleverse*](https://beyond-the-speckleverse.devpost.com/).

I started work on the project on Friday June 7th and completed in the morning of Sunday June 9th. I was a one person team, so 
my effort was spent primarily on coding. I had no previous experience with the Speckle API, and used the hackathon as an 
opportunity to learn it.  

I built the viewer using the [WPF Helix Toolkit library](https://github.com/helix-toolkit/helix-toolkit). 

The Speckle code is loosely based on the [Speckle Unity Connector](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-unity). 

# Future Work 

There are many obvious features once could add, but I think the most intriguing direction is to start adding basic editing capabilities. 

This projects suggests that it could be possible to build a modern standalone BIM editor for Windows on top of the Speckle platform.
