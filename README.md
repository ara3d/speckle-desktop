# Speckle Desktop

[Christopher Diggins's](https://cdiggins.github.io) entry into the June 2024 Speckle Hackathon [*Beyond the Speckleverse*](https://beyond-the-speckleverse.devpost.com/).

Speckle desktop is a windows desktop application for working with the [Speckle 3D platform].

It was built using the following open-source libraries:

* XBim Windows UI toolkit
* Speckle-Sharp .NET API
* Speckle-Unity package 
* Various Ara 3D open-source libraries 

We hope to add:

* Viewing capabilities
* Querying capabilities 
* Efficient offline caching 
* Local LLM chat/query capabilities 
* Dynamic C# scripting
* Procedural geometry creation 
* Database creation		

Ideas that we want to explore:

* Using the Ara3D Geometry adapters for easy interoperability across platforms. 
* Optimization of local Speckle  
* Improvements to XBim UI 
* Using WPF for local application development 
* Speckle to WPF (and Helix)
